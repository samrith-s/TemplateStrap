<h1>TEMPLATE STRAP</h1>

<p>
	A set of basic CSS3 classes to help with positioning for landscape and portrait screens. Additional color classes help you create truly brilliant and yet simplistic UI while easing out a host of stuff. With a lot of shorthands for the majority of the classes, it eases out having to write really long class-names. For people familiar with the syntax, make the code absolutely readable, by a combination of initials and shortnames.
